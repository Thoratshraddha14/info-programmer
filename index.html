                info: `<h3>1. Creating the Linux Kernel</h3>
                In 1991, Linus Torvalds, then a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland, began developing a Unix-like kernel as a personal project.
                He announced it on a newsgroup (comp.os.minix) on August 25, 1991, offering it for free under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
                This project evolved into the Linux kernel, which is the foundation of many modern operating systems, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and Android.
                <h3>2. Founding Git</h3>
                In 2005, due to dissatisfaction with proprietary version control systems (notably BitKeeper), Linus created Git, a distributed version control systems.
                Git is now the most widely used version control systems in the world, especially for software development (including Linux itself).
                <h3>3. Philosophy and Influence</h3>
                Linus is known for his pragmatic engineering approach, focusing on functionality and performance over ideology.
                He has been both praised and criticized for his blunt and outspoken communication style, especially on Linux kernel mailing lists.
                Despite controversies, his technical leadership has shaped the open-source movement.`

                info: `Regarded as the first computer programmer. Wrote the first algorithm for Charles Babbages Analytical Engine.
                <h3>First Computer Program
                Collaboration with Charles Babbage:</h3>
                Ada met Charles Babbage, the inventor of the Analytical Engine, in the 1830s.
                Babbage called her the ‚ÄúEnchantress of Numbers.‚Äù
                Her Historic Work (1842‚Äì1843):
                Translated an Italian mathematician‚Äôs paper on Babbage‚Äôs Analytical Engine.
                Added extensive notes (three times longer than the original paper), labeled A through G.
                <h3>Key Insight:</h3>
                Note G included an algorithm to compute Bernoulli numbers‚Äîwidely recognized as the first published computer program.
                She also:
                Understood the machine could manipulate symbols, not just numbers
                Theorized that such a machine might compose music or art‚Äîa vision of general-purpose computing
                <h3>üåü Why She‚Äôs Important</h3>
                She saw beyond computation: While Babbage focused on number-crunching, Ada foresaw that machines could follow instructions and perform symbolic operations.
                She laid the groundwork for modern computing concepts such as loops and conditional logic.
                Advocated for computational creativity, a concept still central to AI and programming philosophy today.
                <h3>üèÖ Legacy</h3>
                Often called the ‚ÄúFirst Computer Programmer.‚Äù
                Honored in countless ways:
                Ada programming language (used by the U.S. Department of Defense) named in her honor.
                Ada Lovelace Day (second Tuesday of October) celebrates women in STEM.
